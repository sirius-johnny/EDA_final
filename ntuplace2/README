  If you have any problem in building ntuplace, please run "automake" in 
the project root directory. This project is now using automake 1.4 in stead
of automake 1.9.
  If problem still exists, please 'make distclean' to clean out old Makefiles
and run 'configure'. A new set of Makefiles would be generated and everything 
should goes fine.
